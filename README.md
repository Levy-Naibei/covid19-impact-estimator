This app built with python is meant to help society and leaders prepare for the **real big problem** of COVID-19, which is **its impact on lives, health systems, supply chains, and the economy**: 
> 1.  Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks and other PPE - if *we donâ€™t practice social distancing*.
> 2.  Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production (even for essentials like food). These and more from too many people being sick, a sizable number dying (including some of the best people in many fields), and many others affected by the impact of losing loved ones or a world operating in slow motion
